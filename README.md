Create a single app screen that displayed the information in the screenshot. Each client would have a similar screen branded to their organization. A few notes:
 
- The logo image can be uploaded by the client so sizes may vary - do your best to maintain a uniform look across screens
- The name and description of the organization may vary in length (replace the description with your own content)
- As a bonus, clicking the "Give Now!" button should show some type of interactivity or confirmation message and increase the progress bar/thermometer
